## Project Descriptions

### Task 1 : Temperature Converter
- This simple web application allows you to swiftly convert temperatures between Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K).
- Explore the code and witness the magic of temperature conversion in action. Feel free to use and adapt this project to enhance your web development skills or integrate it into your own applications.
  
- A temperature converter is a tool or a program that allows you to convert temperatures from one scale to another. The most common temperature scales used are Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). Here's a brief description of each scale:

Celsius (°C): This is a temperature scale where 0°C is the freezing point of water, and 100°C is the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure. It is widely used in most countries for everyday temperature measurements.

Fahrenheit (°F): Developed by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, this scale also uses the freezing and boiling points of water, but with different reference points compared to Celsius. In this scale, 32°F is the freezing point of water, and 212°F is the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. It is commonly used in the United States and a few other countries.

Kelvin (K): The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale where 0 K (absolute zero) represents the lowest theoretically possible temperature where all thermal motion ceases. The Kelvin scale is used primarily in scientific contexts, especially in physics and chemistry.


### Task 2 : Homepage of Netflix
- Explore the code for a stunning Netflix-inspired homepage. In this repository, I've recreated the look and feel of Netflix's homepage using HTML, CSS and JS.
- This project showcases my web development skills in designing a captivating web layout that resembles the popular streaming service's interface.
- Explore the code and layout, use it as a reference, and get inspired for your web design projects. Dive in and experience the art of web design!
